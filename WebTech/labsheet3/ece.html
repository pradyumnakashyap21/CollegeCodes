        Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) is a dynamic field focusing on the design, development, and testing of electronic equipment, communication systems, and integrated circuits. It merges principles from electrical engineering, physics, and computer science to advance technologies like IoT, 5G, and robotics. ECE professionals are essential for developing devices such as smartphones, sensors, and embedded systems.
